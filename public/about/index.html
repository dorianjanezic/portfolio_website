              <p>Matt Romein is an artist and performer working at the intersection of live performance, generative computer art, and multi-media installation. Originally trained as an actor, he has worked in NYCâ€™s downtown theater and dance community as a sound and video designer while also making his own technology-centric live performances.</p>
              <p>He attended NYU Tisch School of the Arts ITP, a graduate program focusing on experimental and artistic uses of technology. He now teaches there as an adjunct professor with classes focused on live video performance and the usage of avatars in an artistic practice.</p>
              <p>His current artistic research explores how the physical body is represented in digital spaces and how those bodies can be manipulated in evocative and unsettling ways in order to challenge ideas of identity, autonomy, and ethics.</p>
